Lab reservation website for students.

## How to Run:
1. **Download XAMPP**:  
   - You can download XAMPP from [this link](https://www.apachefriends.org/).
   
2. **Clone the Repository**:  
   - Clone this repository into the `C:\xampp\htdocs\` folder.

3. **Start XAMPP**:
   - Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
   - Press **Start** for both **Apache** and **MySQL** services.

4. **Troubleshooting**:
   - If either **Apache** or **MySQL** does not start, check the ports they are using (often due to conflicts).
   - For **MySQL**, check if it's already running by looking in the **Task Manager**.
     - If MySQL is running, end the process and try starting it again.

5. **Access the Website**:
   - Once both services are running, open your browser and go to:
     ```
     http://localhost/<folder-name>
     ```
     Replace `<folder-name>` with the actual folder name where the repo is in the `htdocs` directory.
