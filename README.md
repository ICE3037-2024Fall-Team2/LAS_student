# LAS_student
Lab reservation website for students

Guide:
To run this website, download XAMPP https://www.apachefriends.org/
Then clone this repo to the 'C:\xampp\htdocs' folder
In the XAMPP Control Panel press start 'Apache' and 'MySQL'
If any one of these does not start, check the ports they are using
Also, for MySQL, I suggest checking Task Manager 
If MySQL is running, End the process and try starting it again
When both actions run, go to 'http://localhost/' + folder name after '\htdocs\...'
